# Mini Project 1

## A first project involving creating a webpage with a contact form for a fictional company. 
   This project was our fist task without having any starter code and building an html page from scratch. 
  This project taught us to design a basic contact us landing page without the handholding of providing most of the starter code. 
  We were given creative liberty for the project, so all margins and colors were left up to each student for their own page as long as it is visually appealing.
